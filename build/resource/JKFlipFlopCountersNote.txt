Designing a JK flip flop Synchronous Counter
When designing a synchronous counter, every bit would need a flip flop. 
For example, a 3-bit counter will need three flip flops, a 4-bit
counter will need four flip flops, etc. Now that you have an understanding 
of logic gates, karnaugh’s map and flip flops (JK, T & D), it’s time to 
design Synchronous Counters.

Example 1:
In this example, we will be designing a synchronous counter using
JK flip flops, that counts in the following sequence, 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 
and repeats.




Step 1: Determine the least amount of bits that needs to be used.
To develop this synchronous counter, the excitation table must be used.
It is used to help develop the transition state table for our synchronous 
counter.

Before designing our state table however, we must first calculate 
the least amount of bits we need to use.

To determine the smallest number of bits we need to use, is given by 
the formula: 2^n-1 = Last count

In our example, the last count is 7. So 2n-1 =7. Therefore, n is equal to 3, which 
means we need to use at least 3 bits.


Step 2: Design the state table
Since we are going to be using 3 bits, we can represent each bit with A, B 
and C. So, the present state will be Qa, Qb and Qc and our next state 
will be Qa+1, Qb+1 and Qc+1. 

The present state fields should then be filled out from top to bottom 
beginning with our first count to our last count in binary. 
Note well: Even those that are not in the sequence are filled in.
The next state fields will then be filled out from top to bottom as well.
However, it is filled out by looking at the current present state and 
placing its next state in that position. E.g. at present state 0 (000) 
its next state will be 1(001), at present state 1(001) its next state will be 2(010), etc. 
Note well: The question stated that after the last sequence it repeats. 
Therefore, at present state 7(111) its next state will be 0(000). The state t
able should look like figure 2 at the side.
Now it is time to represent the other three bits (Ja, Ka, Jb, Kb, Jc & Kc). 
This is where the excitation table comes into play. You first start off by 
looking at the first value of Qa and the first value of Qa+1. In this 
example, the first value of Qa is 0 and the first value of Qa+1 is also 
0. We then look at our excitation table and see that a 0 for Q(n) which 
is Qa and a 0 FOR Q(n+1) which is Qa+1, J will be 0 and K will be X. 
This process is then repeated for all the values of Qa and Qa+1. The 
State table should then be looking as figure 3, as shown on the side.







This process is also repeated using Jb & Kb and Jc & Kc as well. The 
state table should then be completed (as shown in Figure 4).













Step 3: Determining the minimum sum of products for all of the inputs, 
JK for each of the flip flops.
This step is where your knowledge of Karnaugh’s map comes into play. 
A Karnaugh’s map needs to be plotted from every J(Ja, Jb, Jc) and K(Ka, Kb, Kc).
To do this, you will plot every value of Ja, Jb, Jc, Ka, Kb & Kc with the 
corresponding present state value. The results are shown at the side.









Step 3: Determining the minimum sum of products for all of the inputs, 
JK for each of the flip flops.
This step is where your knowledge of Karnaugh’s map comes into play. 
A Karnaugh’s map needs to be plotted from every J(Ja, Jb, Jc) and K(Ka, Kb, Kc).
To do this, you will plot every value of Ja, Jb, Jc, Ka, Kb & Kc with the 
corresponding present state value. The results are shown at the side.

corresponding present state value. The results are shown at the side.









Step 4: Build the circuit
As mentioned in the beginning, when designing a synchronous counter, every 
bit would need a flip flop. For example, a 3-bit counter will need 
three flip flops, a 4-bit counter will need four flip flops, etc. In this
example, we have a 3-bit counter, so therefore we will need to use three flip flops.
Now it’s time to build the circuit, based on the inputs that we found from 
Karnaugh’s map. Your circuit should look like figure 5 on the side.
